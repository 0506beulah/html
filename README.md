# HTML

This is the repository for the [Working Draft of the HTML specification](https://w3c.github.io/html/)

The specification is built using Bikeshed. If you would like to propose edits, please make sure that they result in a specification that will build correctly, by testing in your own clone of the repository.

1. Install [bikeshed](https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed)
2. From the HTML folder open a command prompt
3. run bikeshed: `'bikeshed -f spec'`
